# Documentation for NIRCAM-line-finding code

Farhan Hasan, created 2/13/2025 ([fhasan@stsci.edu](mailto:fhasan@stsci.edu))

Last updated 5/29/2025

This software is used to identify line-emitting objects and measure emission line properties in JWST NIRCam WFSS Grism spectra, based on the pure-parallel survey POPPIES (PID#5398).

This code was adapted from the JWST WFSS line-finding code for the PASSAGE survey ([https://github.com/jwstwfss/line-finding](https://github.com/jwstwfss/line-finding)), which itself was adapted from A. Henry's WISP fitting code (with Battisti et al., 2024).

## How it works


A user interactively inspects emission line candidates using 1D and 2D spectra and images.

The user makes a choice between 1) analyzing all objects identified from the photometry, or 2) analyzing the subset of objects that are identified as potential emission line objects using a peak finding algorithm that performs a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) on the spectral data (see SciPys's [find_peaks_cwt](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks_cwt.html)). The code iterates through the potential emission lines, allowing the reviewers to identify lines or reject spurious detections quickly and efficiently.

The user will be asked to enter the number of a parallel field and a username of choice. The fitting is then performed on an object-by-object basis.

## How to install and run

Steps for installation are as follows

1. Make sure you have python 3.9 or later installed
2. pip install the following packages:
	- numpy>=1.26.4
	- astropy>=5.3, <7
	- pandas>=1.0, <3
	- scipy==1.14.1 (this one is strict)
	- matplotlib>=3.6, <3.11
3. Git clone [https://github.com/jwstwfss/NIRCam-line-finding.git](https://github.com/jwstwfss/NIRCam-line-finding.git)
4. Install **XPA** from: [https://github.com/ericmandel/xpa](https://github.com/ericmandel/xpa)

a) Git clone from the repo

b) Then, cd into the xpa directory

c) `./configure --prefix=<top_level_install_dir>` # site-specific configuration

`make`  # build the software

`make install` # install it

`make clean` # clean up unneeded temp files

d) Add the path to your bash:

`export PATH=<path/to/software>:$PATH`

e.g., export PATH=/Users/fhasan/Desktop/Software/xpa/bin:$PATH

[See more instructions in *xpa/INSTALL*]

5. Add NIRCAM-line-finding/poppies_analysis to your **$PYTHONPATH**. In your *~/.bash_profile* file, include the following line:

`export PYTHONPATH="<path/to/code>"`

e.g., export PYTHONPATH= "/Users/fhasan/POPPIES/line-finding/poppies_analysis/"

(Alternatively, if you use csh, add to ~/.cshrc: `setenv PYTHONPATH <path/to/code>:${PYTHONPATH}`)

6. Install the ***stenv*** Conda environment: [https://stenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://stenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

[Make sure to activate your stenv, e.g., `conda activate stenv`]

7. Install **DS9** if you haven't already: [https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9](https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9)


Steps for running the line-finding tool after installing are as follows:

1. Download the data.
2. Point CODE_DIR, OUTPUT_DIR, and DATA_DIR to the appropriate directories in the [mainPOPPIES.py](http://mainPOPPIES.py) file.
3. Run `python mainPOPPIES.py`
4. Enter the number of the parallel field (e.g., "004").
5. Hit ENTER or 'c' to go through the wavelength decomposition and find peaks, and only go through candidates identified by this method, or 'all' to go through all objects identified photometrically.
6. Enter a username.
7. Inspect objects individually.
8. Choose what to do with each object (accept, reject, etc.). The outputs are saved in the OUTPUT_DIR directory, including line catalogs and 1D spectra figures.
